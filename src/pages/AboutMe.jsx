        <p className="text-muted">
          Hi! My name is <strong>Daniel Llorens</strong>, and I truly appreciate
          you taking the time to visit my <strong>React portfolio</strong>. I'm
          currently a student in
          <strong> UCF’s and Ed-X’s Web Development Bootcamp</strong>, where I’m
          honing my skills in front-end and back-end development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          Originally, I pursued a <strong>business degree</strong>, but I’ve
          always had a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. I
          believe my background in business gives me strong
          <strong> communication and collaboration skills</strong>, which are
          essential for working effectively in a development team. My goal is to
          combine these strengths with my growing technical expertise to
          transition into the tech industry as a{" "}
          <strong>software developer</strong>, and eventually work my way up to
          a <strong>team leadership role</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted">
          I built this website to <strong>showcase the projects</strong> I've
          developed throughout the bootcamp. Each project represents the skills
          I’ve learned and the progress I’ve made in my journey as a developer.
          This portfolio itself is one of those projects—designed and built
          using <strong>React</strong>, one of the most powerful and popular
          JavaScript libraries for modern web development.
        </p>
