        Hi! My name is Daniel Llorens, and I truly appreciate you taking the
        time to visit my React portfolio. I'm currently a student in UCF’s and
        Ed-X’s Web Development Bootcamp, where I’m honing my skills in front-end
        and back-end development. Originally, I pursued a business degree, but
        I’ve always had a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. I
        believe my background in business gives me strong communication and
        collaboration skills, which are essential for working effectively in a
        development team. My goal is to combine these strengths with my growing
        technical expertise to transition into the tech industry as a software
        developer, and eventually work my way up to a team leadership role. I
        built this website to showcase the projects I've developed throughout
        the bootcamp. Each project represents the skills I’ve learned and the
        progress I’ve made in my journey as a developer. This portfolio itself
        is one of those projects—designed and built using React, one of the most
        powerful and popular JavaScript libraries for modern web development.
        Thank you again for stopping by! Feel free to check out my work, and
        don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect.
      </p>
